<p>Kaolin particle movies used in organic farming may control some pests, but can adversely affect natural enemies and cause other pests to multiply (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices may encourage natural opponent populations, but a greater number of natural opponents does not always lead to pest suppression (Dara 2014 ).
