We normally recommend pest control chemicals that finish the job using the least quantity of product. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last resort). These prevention and control strategies include biological, mechanical, cultural, physical, genetic, chemical, and regulatory techniques.</p>
<p>This might consist of making use of multiple pesticides with various modes of action. Trap crops are planted to bring in and hold pest insects where they can be handled more effectively and prevent or reduce their movement onto valuable crops.
