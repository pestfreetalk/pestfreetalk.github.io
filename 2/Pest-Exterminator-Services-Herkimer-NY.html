For some jobs, pest control workers use a combination of pest management strategies, a practice known as incorporated pest management. The foundation of a reliable IPM program is a schedule of regular inspections. Crop losses due to illness, arthropods, and weeds, though contested by some as a valid measure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the augmentation of pest control.</p>
