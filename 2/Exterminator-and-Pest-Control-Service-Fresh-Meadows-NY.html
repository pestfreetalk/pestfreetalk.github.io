<p>Community IPM specialists work to identify and correct pest-friendly conditions, getting rid of access to food, water and harborage by improving sanitation, upkeep, exclusion and landscape management practices. When it refused to hunt the target types and ended up being a pest itself, the cane toad is another case showing biological control failure in this regard.</p>
