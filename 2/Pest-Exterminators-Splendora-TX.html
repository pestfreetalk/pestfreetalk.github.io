With more regulations on pesticide usage and a decrease in the number of active components in some crops, there is a greater emphasis on better understanding of offered control choices (Hillocks 2012 ).

We are an ISO 9001:2008, 14001:14004 certified company and are a member of Indian Pest Control Association (IPCA) and National Pest Management Association (NPMA).

<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can quickly accomplish levels at which damage is caused thus ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For example, a rich neighborhood likely will have a lot of big, expensive houses, so pest control costs could be greater there since there's more territory for a pest control company to cover in one of those homes.</p>
