Insecticides hazardous to many insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely impact natural opponents than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for particular insect species or life stages.</p>
<p>Transgenic plants resistant to insect pest are also important tactical methods for future execution of IPM. 2 Annual Service offers 2 year protection from Termites.
