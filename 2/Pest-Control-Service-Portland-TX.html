<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and prevent pest determination consist of intercropping (multiple crops in the same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests away from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
<p>IPM is a versatile approach which makes the best use of all available technologies to handle pest issues efficiently and securely. Simply put, with Spoon River Pest Control's competence, you can tailor our approach and services to eliminate undesirable trespassers for good in the most affordable of ways.

Rentokil PCI is India's leading pest control services and products brand name that provides integrated pest management services to house owners and organisations in over 300 locations in the country. This monitoring and identification gets rid of the possibility that pesticides will be used when they are not truly required or that the wrong sort of pesticide will be utilized.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been recommended as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not take off since growers were not prepared for such an intercropping arrangement. If your center currently uses an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be amazed to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to move toward least-impact services and products.</p>
