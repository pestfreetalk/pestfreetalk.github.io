To deplore an effective IPM program, literature and other information sources about the pest, the pest's life process, host range, circulation, movement, and fundamental biology will have to be looked into.</p>
<p>This technique describes the use of a variety of mechanical or physical methods for pest exemption, trapping (in many cases similar to the behavioral control), removal, or destruction (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exemption with netting or row covers, handpicking or vacuuming to get rid of pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, customizing ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, visual or physical bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic gadgets are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>

Unintentional effect on the end product - extreme usage burns leaves and roots, triggers plant fading, and crops tend to keep dangerous amounts of pesticides hazardous for customers.</p>
<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal dosages of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience slowed down advancement and feeding and go through greater parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ). In other words, an effective, nondisruptive method to handle a moderate beet armyworm break out might be to retard its development and damage while providing the parasitoids time to work, thus enhancing the parasitoids' effect during subsequent generations.</p>
