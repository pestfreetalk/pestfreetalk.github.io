The term pest" describes more than one cause of issues consisting of diseases, unfavorable insects, termites, weeds, nematodes and mollusks. A number of treatment approaches have actually been utilized, including chemical approaches, such as pesticide applications and toxic gas fumigations; and non-chemical treatments, such as freezing or heating up the products, using micro-waves, gamma radiation, customized atmospheres, and anoxic fumigation.</p>
