<p>Information on a lot of these prospective dangers for specific pesticides can be discovered on pesticide labels, Security Data Sheets (SDSs) and resources such as the National Pesticide Info Center or the Pesticide Action Network (PAN) Pesticide Database Danger or toxicity and capacity for exposure together represent pesticide threat.

<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been recommended as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not take off because growers were not all set for such an intercropping arrangement. If your facility presently utilizes an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be amazed to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to move toward least-impact services and products.</p>
