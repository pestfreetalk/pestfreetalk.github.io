<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>SCRAM! Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and dissuade pest determination consist of intercropping (several crops in the exact same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
<p>At Aegis Pest Control we are devoted to providing the best possible service to protect against unwanted pests. The following example explains the six elements of an Integrated Pest Management program used to manage carpenter ants.
