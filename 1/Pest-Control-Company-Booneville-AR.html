Pest control is the policy or management of a types specified as a pest, a member of the animal kingdom that affects adversely on human activities.</p>

Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been picked either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have greater levels of resistance.</p>
<p>Only then can we lower the use of artificial fertilizers, minimize dependence on pesticides and boost productivity. Here, insecticides will only be utilized when they are economically practical and it appears that natural enemies will not control the pests.
