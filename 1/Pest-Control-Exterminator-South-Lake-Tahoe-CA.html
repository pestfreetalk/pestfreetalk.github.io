Besides routine external spraying, whenever there was believed to be a threat of a pest issue developing, there was no documented or regular pest control program at MTSL at the time of the initial audit.</p>
<p>For instance, if you're not sure whether you have carpenter ants or termites, get help determining the pest from your local extension service or exterminator. General pest control supplies you complete defense from the pests that currently inhabit your home as well as from the pests that may attack in the future.
