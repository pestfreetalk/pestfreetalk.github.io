IPM coordinates using pest biology, ecological info, and available innovation to prevent undesirable levels of pest damage by the most economical ways, while minimizing threat to people, property, resources, and the environment.</p>
<p>Not all insects, weeds, and other living organisms require control. For this reason, termite pest control must be done every few months or when a year.
