<p>TNT Termite suggests a full-perimeter treatment using an authorized termiticide to properly protect your home from extra termite infestation or damage. Neighborhood IPM professionals work to identify and remedy pest-friendly conditions, eliminating access to food, water and harborage by improving sanitation, maintenance, exclusion and landscape management practices. The cane toad is another case highlighting biological control failure in this regard when it declined to hunt the target types and became a pest itself.</p>
<p>Control of rodents includes the elimination of harbourage in and around structures and preventing access to water, food and shelter. As part of the Sustainable Use Instruction, the UK government is required to show that UK growers are using integrated pest management practices.
