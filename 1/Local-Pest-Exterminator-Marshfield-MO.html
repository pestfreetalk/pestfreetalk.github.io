<p>Enhancement through propagation and release of natural opponents is an area of biological control that has gotten much attention in recent years. This part deals with the management element of the new IPM model for information collection, organization, and actual actions versus pest problems. This focuses on monitoring the life process and frequency of pests to determine the best pest control techniques for the current and following growing season.</p>
<p>A technique that involves making use of pest-tolerant and pest-resistant cultivars developed through standard breeding or genetic modification (Douglas 2018, Kennedy 2008, Nelson et al. 2018 ).
