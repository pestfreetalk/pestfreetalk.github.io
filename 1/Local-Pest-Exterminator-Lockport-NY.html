Besides routine external spraying, whenever there was thought to be a threat of a pest issue developing, there was no documented or regular pest control program at MTSL at the time of the preliminary audit.</p>
<p>Pest management requires a holistic technique to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are used only after routine monitoring indicates that a pest population had reached a financial threshold level. Lots of individual product growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to define what IPM means for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are available in restricted areas.</p>
<p>In contrast, organic food production applies many of the very same ideas as IPM but restricts using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to decrease the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
