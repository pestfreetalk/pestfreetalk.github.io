<p>The most effective method for managing pests is to combine methods in an approach known as Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Reputable estimates of IPM adoption are not available presently for most crops. You may not require to fret about the four pest control actions simply pointed out IF you make the effort to prevent pests in the first place. Pesticides help fill that space.
