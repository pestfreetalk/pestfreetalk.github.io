<p>Pesticides are picked and applied in such a way that lessens their possible harm to individuals, nontarget organisms, and the environment. IPM is most likely to be misinterpreted as pest management without chemicals which in fact requirement based usage of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing center through the supply chain, in the ingredients or product packaging, and the center itself will attract pests through food smells and lighting.</p>
