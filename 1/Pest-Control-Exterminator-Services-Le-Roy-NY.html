Biopesticides (also known as biological pesticides), derived from natural products, are usually less hazardous than standard pesticides due to the fact that they generally target particular pests.</p>

Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been picked either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to possess higher levels of resistance.</p>
