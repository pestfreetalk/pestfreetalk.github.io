It needs a greater understanding of the pest, crop and the environment. In Jones, the complainants were a husband and wife who had actually moved into a home on an Air Force base that had been sprayed by a pest control service with a pesticide containing chlordane.</p>
<p>Termites eat furniture, papers, books, and even files kept in safes and lockers, hence triggering gigantic damage within just a couple of months. This stops the pest gaining resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or used to the crops. Exterminators go to client homes and organisations to check for insects or rodents.
