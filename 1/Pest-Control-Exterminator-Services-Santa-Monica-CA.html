<p>Since the term IPM has been coopted by the chemical industry to mean essentially anything a practitioner wants it to suggest, Beyond Pesticides has embraced the expression Ecological Pest Management."

A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or disease occurrence and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that a lack of qualified IPM experts and extension teachers was an impediment for IPM implementation in industrialized nations.</p>
