<p>In referral to the principle of integrating making use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later on broadened to accept coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have greater levels of resistance.</p>
<p>In contrast, organic food production uses a lot of the very same concepts as IPM but limits making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than artificial chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to reduce the requirement for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
<p>The principle has been around since the 1920's when cotton pest management program was established. Pest control companies understand the right pesticide to utilize in any situation, this conserves a lot of costs. Poisoning by exposure to pesticides may take place quickly after a single direct exposure (acute poisoning) or gradually after duplicated exposures over an amount of time (persistent poisoning).</p>
