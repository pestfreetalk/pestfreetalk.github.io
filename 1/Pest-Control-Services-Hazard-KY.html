<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control family bug pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a a lot more simplistic definition of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly exclusively about reducing pesticide usage. If all other incorporated pest management tactics are not able to keep an insect pest population listed below a financial threshold, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is warranted.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been recommended as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not take off due to the fact that growers were not prepared for such an intercropping arrangement. If your facility presently uses an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be amazed to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to move toward least-impact product or services.</p>
