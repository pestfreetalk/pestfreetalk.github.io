Unique safety measures must be required to keep pest control treatments from threatening food safety. IPM is an information-intensive, site-specific, multitactic approach to pest control.</p>

Ecological Pest Management much better represents the focus professionals need to have -highlighting the more comprehensive ecology of pest management and preventing harmful chemicals unless there are no alternatives.</p>
