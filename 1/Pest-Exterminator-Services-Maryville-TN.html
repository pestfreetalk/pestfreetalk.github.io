<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, use of resistant ranges, proper irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the ecosystem as an entire and thinks about a well balanced mix of the abovementioned control techniques to produce the most effective and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>This approach refers to making use of a range of physical or mechanical techniques for pest exclusion, trapping (sometimes similar to the behavioral control), removal, or damage (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exclusion with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to get rid of pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, customizing ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sanitation or solarization, visual or physical bird deterrents such as reflective product or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
<p>IPM methods include both chemical and nonchemical means to avoid and control pest populations from reaching financially harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the smallest effective dosage when other techniques of pest control have stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based method that concentrates on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of strategies such as biological control, environment adjustment, adjustment of cultural practices, and usage of resistant varieties.</p>
