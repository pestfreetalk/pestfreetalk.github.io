It's possible that the repeated usage of pesticides might be more dangerous in the long term than the pests themselves.

TAP insulation for attics, wetness barriers for crawl spaces, and specially engineered weather stripping for garage and entry doors not only prevent rodents and other harmful pests from going into and living in your home, they're energy efficient, too.</p>
