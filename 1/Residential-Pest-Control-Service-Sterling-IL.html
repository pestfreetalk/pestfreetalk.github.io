Biological control - indicates a normal method of ruining pests as it happens in nature. Early detection of arthropod pests helps prevent the need to handle substantial populations that may trigger crop damage. Safety problems and eco-friendly disturbances continue to occur (Wright, 1996 ), and there are restored appeals for effective, safe, and financially acceptable alternatives (Benbrook, 1996 ). Synthetic chemical pesticides are the most widely utilized method of pest control.</p>
