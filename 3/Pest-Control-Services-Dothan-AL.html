<p>Fire ants would probably top everyone's list when it comes to insect pests! . Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a broad-based and sustainable approach that integrates practices for the financial avoidance and control of pests and diseases in crops.  Unique precautions must be required to keep pest control treatments from threatening food security. IPM is an information-intensive, site-specific, multitactic method to pest control.</p>
<p>People who lack chemical, biological and electronic methods of controlling a pest population will typically rely on physical methods. One Time Treatments, Quarterly, & Month-to-month Services. On the other hand, treatment services offered more frequently than 3 times per year are not essential with top quality products used by expert professionals.

<p>Worldwide, more than 500 species of spiders, insects, and mites have established some level of pesticide resistance. Pesticides can take the form of a solid, liquid, powder or spray. Trap crops: Some cotton pests prefer crops like maize, sunflower, okra (woman finger), sorghum, pigeon pea or hibiscus to cotton. IPM sees your garden and its pests as part of a bigger environment and manages both with the huge picture in mind.</p>
