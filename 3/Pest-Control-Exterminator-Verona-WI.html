<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural opponents and prevent pest determination include intercropping (numerous crops in the very same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
<p>The principle of incorporated pest management (IPM), a sustainable technique for handling pests, has remained in practice for a very long time. Crops genetically engineered to produce Bt contaminants are planted in countless hectares worldwide. Freezer is also considered a physical control and, although it does not necessarily eliminate the insect pests, it at least stops their development and further feeding on the saved crop.</p>
<p>Because the term IPM has actually been coopted by the chemical industry to indicate essentially anything a professional desires it to mean, Beyond Pesticides has actually accepted the phrase Ecological Pest Management." Ecological Pest Management much better represents the focus professionals need to have -emphasizing the broader ecology of pest management and preventing harmful chemicals unless there are no options.</p>
<p>Other consistent and emerging pest issues consist of vectored human and animal diseases such as West Nile virus, Eastern horse encephalitis and Lyme disease; plant pests and diseases such as emerald ash borer and soybean rust; and more than 170 noxious marine, terrestrial or parasitic weeds continue to challenge pest supervisors in the U.S. and somewhere else, and need effective pest management measures.</p>
