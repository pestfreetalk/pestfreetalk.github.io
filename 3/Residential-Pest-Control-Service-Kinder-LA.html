<p>. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a sustainable and broad-based  approach that integrates practices for the financial prevention and control of pests and diseases in crops.  Special safety measures should be taken to keep pest control treatments from threatening food security. IPM is an information-intensive, site-specific, multitactic approach to pest control.</p>
<p>Instead, call HiCare and have our service technicians inspect your houses for white ants and termites. And vice versa, pest management experts can use video to record and tell examinations and leave a copy for the facility supervisor by means of email, or carry out a real-time video co-inspection with the consumer if they are not able to be present at their center throughout the evaluation.</p>
<p>Consider alternative techniques (besides pesticides) to make your house and garden unsightly to pests. With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from ending up being a problem, such as by growing a healthy crop that can withstand pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from entering a structure. Recent quests for reliable, safe, and lasting pest management programs have been targeted primarily toward development of brand-new and better items with which to replace traditional hazardous pesticides.</p>
<p>Provide food and shelter for the helpful insects (e.g., blooming plants which supply nectar). In IPM programs, growers utilize their knowledge of crop and pest biology to take actions that minimize the environment's suitability for pest facility and increases in pest populations. We supply reliable and fast options to your pest issues with exact same day service.</p>
