<p>Other persistent and emerging pest problems include vectored animal and human diseases such as West Nile infection, Eastern horse encephalitis and Lyme illness; plant pests and diseases such as emerald ash borer and soybean rust; and more than 170 toxic marine, terrestrial or parasitic weeds continue to challenge pest managers in the U.S. and somewhere else, and need reliable pest management measures.</p>
<p>With IPM you'll utilize the most selective pesticide that will do the job and be the safest for other organisms and for water, air, and soil quality; usage pesticides in bait stations rather than sprays; or spot-spray a few weeds instead of an entire area. Due to any variety of reasons, including those mentioned in the Chemical and Cultural areas, jeopardizing the efficiency of natural opponents frequently allows potential pest organisms to experience practically unregulated population development and enables them to reach pest status.</p>
