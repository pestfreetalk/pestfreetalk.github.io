<p>Other persistent and emerging pest problems include vectored animal and human diseases such as West Nile infection, Eastern horse encephalitis and Lyme illness; plant pests and diseases such as emerald ash borer and soybean rust; and more than 170 toxic marine, terrestrial or parasitic weeds continue to challenge pest managers in the U.S. and somewhere else, and need reliable pest management measures.</p>
<p>With IPM you'll utilize the most selective pesticide that will do the job and be the safest for other organisms and for water, air, and soil quality; usage pesticides in bait stations rather than sprays; or spot-spray a few weeds instead of an entire area.
