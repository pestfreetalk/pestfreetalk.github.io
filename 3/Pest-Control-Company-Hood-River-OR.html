<p>It uses a combination of practices and control approaches with the objective of preventing issues from occurring and lowering the requirement for pesticide intensive activities such as broadacre spraying. Also, think about policies and procedures that might unknowingly introduce pests: storage practices and equipment, maintenance, and housekeeping practices. The term was later expanded to embrace coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (13 ). Subsequently, under the term IPM," different authors have actually advocated the principle of including the complete range of pest management practices together with production objectives into an overall systems technique.</p>
