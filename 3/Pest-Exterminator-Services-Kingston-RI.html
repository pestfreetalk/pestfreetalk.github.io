Integrated pest management (IPM) is a holistic approach towards pest threat management by utilising proactive control methods. Insecticides are categorized in several methods, and it is essential to be familiar with these classifications so that the option of an insecticide is based upon more than simply how well it manages the pest.</p>
<p>Reliable, less risky pest controls are selected first, consisting of extremely targeted chemicals, such as scents to interrupt pest breeding, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding.
