<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a efficient and ecologically delicate  technique to pest management that counts on a combination of common-sense practices. IPM is a technique to ensure economic viability at both customer and producer level (seller is constantly anticipated to earn a profit), environmental safety through a balanced usage of all offered pest control alternatives, and social reputation because IPM-based food is affordable and safe.</p>

For the majority of landscape pests, you need to consider pesticides in only the first 2 classifications. The essential effort that goes into pest control does not end when the pesticide spraying stops. Applications of some fungicides directed at controlling plant diseases can likewise decrease the incidence of fungal illness of insects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, natural food production uses a lot of the very same ideas as IPM but restricts using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than artificial chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to reduce the need for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
