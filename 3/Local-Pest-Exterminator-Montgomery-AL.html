<p>Termites eat furnishings, papers, books, and even files kept in lockers and safes, therefore causing gigantic damage within simply a few months. This stops the pest acquiring resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or applied to the crops. Exterminators go to customer homes and services to examine for insects or rodents. Classical biological control involves introducing natural enemies from a pest's native range into a new area where native natural opponents do not supply control.</p>
