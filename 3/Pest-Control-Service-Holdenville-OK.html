When termites have actually gone into a structure, they do not limit themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more. In some methods, IPM can be deemed a decision-making procedure in which observations (from examination and monitoring) are utilized to make pest control decisions based on pre-determined management goals.</p>
<p>Generally, the primary goal of IPM programs is on farming insect pests (IPM Standards, 2009 ). Although, initially developed for farming pest management, IPM programmes are now established to encompass illness, weeds, and other pests that might interfere with the management goals of sites such as residential and industrial structures, yard and turf areas, and house and neighborhood gardens.</p>
