<p>Lots of more recent pesticides are stemmed from plants or naturally occurring compounds (e.g.-- bug, nicotine and pyrethrum juvenile hormone analogues), but the toxophore or active component might be altered to offer increased biological activity or stability. The majority of researchers agree that this will be possible just if we cultivate crops according to the concept of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).</p>
<p>Effective, less risky pest controls are selected initially, consisting of highly targeted chemicals, such as scents to interfere with pest mating, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. Evaluation is typically among the most essential steps in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the procedure of reviewing an IPM program and the results it has actually generated.</p>
