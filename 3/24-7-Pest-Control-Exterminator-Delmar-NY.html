<p>To get more corn per acre, having a solid understanding of the level of pressure and type of pests is key for picking the best corn characteristics and agronomic practices to deal with these challenges.

Non-synthetic or natural pesticides: Botanical-based pesticides fall into this IPM group. Threat for animals - pesticides eliminate non-target (harmless or advantageous) species that habituate in the orchards or fields.
